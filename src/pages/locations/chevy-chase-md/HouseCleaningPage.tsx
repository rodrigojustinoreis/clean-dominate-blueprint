              Capital Clean Care serves all of Chevy Chase's ZIP code 20815 — from the quiet residential streets of
              Section 3 and Section 4 to the upscale Chevy Chase Village and the Connecticut Avenue corridor near

              We regularly clean homes throughout Chevy Chase Lake, Somerset, and the neighborhoods adjoining
              Bethesda. Chevy Chase is one of Montgomery County's most desirable communities, and the residents here
              deserve a cleaning company that respects their time, their homes, and their families. That's why we
              offer flexible appointment windows — including weekday mornings, afternoons, and weekend slots —
              with same-day availability when the schedule permits.

              As a Latino-owned Montgomery County business, we take genuine pride in serving the Chevy Chase
              community. Every team member completes background screening, eco-cleaning training, and a quality
              walk-through checklist before joining our crew. From your first cleaning to your hundredth, you'll
              receive the same meticulous standard — because we treat every home the way we'd want ours cleaned.
